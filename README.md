# ViUR html5

**WARNING: THIS IS AN UNSTABLE PYTHON3 / PYODIDE PORT, WORK IN PROGRESS!**

**html5** is a framework and abstraction layer for writing HTML5 web-apps using Python.

## About

This framework is used to implement HTML5 web-apps using the Python programming language. The framework is an abstraction layer for a DOM running in [Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide), a Python 3 interpreter compiled to web-assembly.

It provides

- class abstraction for all HTML5-DOM-elements, e.g. `html5.Div()`
- a built-in HTML parser and executor to generate DOM objects from HTML-code
- helpers for adding/removing classes, arrange children, handling events etc.

The most prominent software completely established on this library is [ViUR vi](https://github.com/viur-framework/viur-vi/), the visual administration interface for ViUR-based applications.

[ViUR](https://www.viur.dev) is a free software development framework for the [Google App Engine](https://appengine.google.com).

## Quick Start

**Warning: This section is incomplete, a working example will follow soon!**

```python
import html5

class Game(html5.Div):
	def __init__(self):
		super().__init__(
        """
            <label>
                Your Name:
                <input [name]="myInput" type="text" placeholder="Name">
            </label>
            
            <h1>Hello <span [name]="mySpan" class="name">Enter Name</span>!</h1>
        """)
		self.sinkEvent("onChange")

	def onChange(self, event):
		if html5.utils.doesEventHitWidgetOrChildren(event, self.myInput):
			self.mySpan.appendChild(self.myInput["value"], replace=True)

Game()
```
